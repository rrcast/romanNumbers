 Please at least do part 1 (at most up to 3000) and if it's still fun and you've got time, feel free to go on to part 2.



 Don't worry about how far you get... we're more interested in you reaching the point of a well factored Part 1 that goes to 100 than a hacked together Part 1 & 2 that goes to 3000.‚Äù
